Firstly, it's been three years since my last update to this blog. Whilst this was mainly a learning exercise for myself, as well as having my own little corner on the web, I thought now would be a good time to start making semi-regular posts here as I now have quite a lot of time on my hands.

Back in October my girlfriend and I quit our jobs, moved out of London and started an exciting journey traveling South America. Whilst this is something both of us have wanted to do for a while, actually doing it is something else entirely. We are both extremely happy that we bucked up the courage to get on with it and start researching, planning and inevitably booking our flight out of Heathrow and starting our adventure in Lima, Peru. At the time of writing this, we've been in Peru for around five weeks, our next stop being Colombia.
